## About

The event is the first occasion of the *online* meeting about the
programming language Haskell to give a talk or discussion who live or
stay in Japan.

However, you can join the meeting whenever you please, in Japanese
Standard Time (JST), which is 9 hours ahead of UTC.

Haskell Annual Meeting Autumn 2009 (abbr. HAMA.jp 2009) will be held
September 20-23 at the freenode IRC channel. It is open to all -- you do
not have to be a Haskell guru to attend. All you need is a basic
knowledge of Haskell, a willing to learn, and a project you're excited
to help with (or project of your own to work on), finally waking up at
local time where you are. A few people in Japan, who join the meeting,
maybe not going to bed, but still continue to talk with you, probably.

There will be lots of hacking, some talks (informal or formal), and of
course, fun! We apologize to you that we cannot serve any good food nor
drink.

We will create a new channel for the meeting at freenode, but the name
of the channel has been undecided yet. Please check out this page at a
few date before the meeting again. Lambdabot (create link) will be
stayed during the meeting. Thanks Conrad for this good proposal.

The registration does not needed; it will be described below in detail.
However, if you want to give a live talk using USTREAM.tv (link here),
slides or messages, please contact the organizer. We are pleased to
reserve for your presentation or kindly messages. The address of the
organizer will be written at the Contact section.
